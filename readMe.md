 ### About ###

Get It Ticket is a fully integrated platform connecting businesses and venues directly to event goers. The platform allows business administrators to mange their business profiles: managing venues, events, and tickets.

Customers have the ability to: customize a profile, view a list of upcoming events, purchase tickets for those events, and offer no longer wanted tickets to others- if accepted the customer transfers finacial responsiblity to the new customer.

## Getting Started ##

The home page displays all upcoming events

First a user logins in as either a customer, admin for a business, or both.

The following outlines site navigation for an admin user.

If the current user doesn't have an existing profile, they can simply click the signup form to join.

By clicking the manage button, the admin will be taken to the detail page for that specific busniss entity. There the admin can add and delete venues.

Clicking delete, deletes the venue and returns to the same business admin page.

Clicking view venue details, takes the admin to the detail page for the venue where they can add events.
